          >I'm Courtney. A designer, maker and problem solver. <br /></span
        ><br />The cusp of art and technology has always fascinated me and I've
        never been afraid to just jump in and give it a go, whether it's Paint,
        Photoshop, Sketch&nbsp;or CSS. I’ve been designing with computers since
        the day I first opened Microsoft Paint. <br /><br />Fast forward to 2023
        and I’ve tried it all, from Digital Campaign Design and Flash
        Actionscript to Web Design, Animation, HTML/CSS, No-Code Web
        Development, Product Design and Product Management. Everything I have
        done, small or big, has been a vital stepping stone for where I am
        today.<br /><br />What excites me most about being a Product Designer is
        being able to design and create things that have purpose and solve real
        problems. It goes beyond designing buttons and websites and involves
        having a passion for designing experiences and solutions that help
        people, whether it's helping them make better videos, market themselves
        online, or buy something online. Leaning into customer insight and
        understanding their needs, finding the right problems to solve,
        delivering solutions as quickly as possible, learning from those and
        then iterating and improving that value over time is the key to great
        product design.<br /><br />This is one of my favourite quotes (by Peter
        Drucker):<br /><br /><span class="quote"
          >“There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should
          not be done at all.”</span
        ><br />This resonates so deeply with me because I have no desire to make
        pretty things just for the sake of it. Some people love that!&nbsp;But
        it's not for me. I only want to make, design or build ideas and products
        that are real, that matter and have an impact in the world.<br /><br /><span
